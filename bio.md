I am a PhD student at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), working in the [ZERO Lab](https://zero-lab-pku.github.io/), supervised by [Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/) and [Jiansheng Yang](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/peoplefaculty/64.html). My research interests lie in deep equilibrium models and their applications in graph neural networks and image processing. I am currently working on novel paradigms on training large-scale graph neural networks. 

When I'm not doing ML, I like to play racquetball and go hiking.

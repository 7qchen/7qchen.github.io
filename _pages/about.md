I am an Applied Scientist at **AWS AI Labs**, where I build **LLM-powered coding agents**. My research focuses on test-time scaling, benchmark design, and agentic reinforcement learning, with the goal of scaling agents toward fully autonomous, long-horizon software development tasks. I am particularly interested in **coding as a universal interface** -- a medium through which humans and agents can collaboratively shape the digital world.

Prior to Amazon, I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) (2023), advised by [Prof. Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/), [Prof. Yisen Wang](https://yisenwang.github.io/), and [Prof. Jiansheng Yang](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/peoplefaculty/64.html). My doctoral research focused on **deep equilibrium models** (infinitely deep neural networks) for context learning, with applications to computer vision and graph learning.

I’m open to collaboration! Feel free to email me if you’re interested in working together.
